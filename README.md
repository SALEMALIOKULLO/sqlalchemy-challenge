# sqlalchemy-challenge
I will be exploring an SQLite climate database using Python and SQLAlchemy. I will then conduct my analysis utilizing SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

Creating a climate analysis as well as developing an app using Flask API. The app.py Python script was created to design a climate app with a Flask API of 5 routes with JSON lists of climate information. Based on the results of my analysis, I will figure out the weather for my vacational trip to Honolulu, Hawaii.
